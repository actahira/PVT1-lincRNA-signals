# PVT1-lincRNA-signals
The results of signals obtained with CUT&RUN for histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K27me3), EZH2 and AR occupancy along the human genome are available at the zenodo repository under the link https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17137240. Briefly, prostate cancer LNCaP cells were treated with androgen analog R1881 or with solvent (EtOH), with or without PVT1 lincRNA knockdown, and the CUT&RUN assays were performed.

Scripts used to analyze the data (CUT&RUN gene annotation, differential expression/occupancy, WGCNA and module preservation) are available here, in the analysis_scripts folder.
