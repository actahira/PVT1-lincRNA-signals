# PVT1-lincRNA-signals
The scripts of signals obtained by the analysis of CUT&amp;RUN of histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27Ac and H3K27me3), EZH2 and AR are deposited in results_dataset folder. Briefly, prostate cancer LNCaP cell lineages were treated with EtOH and an androgen analogous R1881 and wirh or without PVT1 knockdown.

Scripts used to analyze the data (CUT&RUN gene annotation, differential expression/occupancy, WGCNA and module preservation) are in the analysis_scripts folder.
