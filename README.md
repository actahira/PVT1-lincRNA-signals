# PVT1-lincRNA-signals
The results of signals obtained with CUT&amp;RUN for histone marks (H3K4me1,
H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K27me3), EZH2 and AR occupancy along the
human genome are available at the zenodo repository under the link
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17137240. Scripts used to analyze the data
(CUT&amp;RUN gene annotation, differential expression/occupancy, WGCNA and
module preservation) are available here, in the analysis_scripts folder.
